# NoShowAppointment
I.	INTRODUCTION
The project would like to investigate the data about No-show appointment. This dataset is about more than 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil and would like to find out the insightful information about the presence or absence for a scheduled appointment.
This dataset was extracted from the link: https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/July/5b57919a_data-set-options/data-set-options.pdf

The description of this dataset was also explained the above link.
The investigator would like to explore the key information of this datasets and answer some questions as below:
•	What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
•	Which gender has higher percentage of appointment show-up?
•	What factors are main reasons for not showing up for a schedule appointment?


II.	DATA WRANGLING AND CLEANING
To investigate this dataset, the analyst would like to use Python and Jupyter Notebook for cleaning data and exploring information.
•	Pandas, numpy and matplotlib were imported.
•	The dataset was imported.
•	There are 110527 rows and 14 columns in this dataset.

III.	CONCLUSION
In summary, no scholarship and no SMS receiving are considered the important factors to predict that patients may not show up as scheduled appointment. Patients who at had no scholarship or receive no SMS message or didn’t get both were less likely to appear in the appointments.
Difference in gender didn’t make any difference in predicting the trends.
Health conditions didn’t play significant roles in predicting the trends as the percentage of people having health problems was pretty low. However, among them, hypertension is the most important information.  There are more high blood pressure people who didn’t show up to a scheduled appointment than who did.
Regarding age, there is a group of female patients who are around 41 years old and didn’t show up to the appointment because of no scholarship. There is also a similar male group like that with the median age of 36 years old.
